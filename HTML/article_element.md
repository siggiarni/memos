# Article element

`<article>` isn’t just for blog posts — it’s for any self-contained thing. It also helps WatchOS display your content properly.

Think of `<article>` not just as a newspaper article, or a blog post, but as an article of clothing — a discrete entity that can be reused in another context. So your trousers are an article, and you can wear them with a different outfit; your shirt is an article, and can be worn with different trousers.
