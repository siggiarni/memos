### Media conditions

The first value is a media condition. A media condition is similar to a media query, but not as full featured. For example, you canâ€™t do things like `@media screen`, but you can do everything else you would likely want to do in sizes.
Most commonly, your media condition is going to be a something like `(max-width: 480px)` or maybe `(min-width: 480px)`
