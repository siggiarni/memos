# Display contents

There are plenty of cases where this might be helpful, but the most common one is with flexbox. With flexbox, only the immediate children of a flex container become flex items.
But, once you apply display: contents to a child, its children become flex items and are laid out using the same rules that would have been applied to their parent.
