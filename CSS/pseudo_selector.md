# pseudo-classes vs. pseudo-elements

## Pseudo-class

A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword preceded by a colon (:) that is added on to the end of selectors to specify that you want to style the selected elements only when they are in certain state. 

A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s). For example, `:hover` can be used to change a button's color when the user hovers over it.

## Pseudo-elements

Pseudo-elements are very much like pseudo-classes, but they have differences. They are keywords

A CSS pseudo-element is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a **specific part** of the selected element(s). For example, `::first-line` can be used to change the font of the first line of a paragraph.
