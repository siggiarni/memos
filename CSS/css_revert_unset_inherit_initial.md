# CSS Revert, Unset, Inherit, and Initial

## Revert

The revert CSS keyword reverts the cascaded value of the property from its current value to the value the property would have had if no changes had been made by the current style origin to the current element.

## Unset

The unset CSS keyword resets a property to its inherited value if it inherits from its parent, and to its initial value if not.

## Inherit

The inherit CSS keyword causes the element for which it is specified to take the computed value of the property from its parent element.

## Initial

The initial CSS keyword applies the initial value of a property to an element. This initial value is set by the browser.
