# :root

Is a [structural pseudo-class](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-3/#structural-pseudos).

> structural pseudo-classes are permitted to selection based on extra information that lies in the document tree but cannot be represented by other simple selectors or combinators.

The `:root` pseudo-class represents an element that is the root of the document. In HTML, this is always the `HTML` element. 

`:root` is the same as `html`, but with higher specificity
