## CH Unit

Equal to the used advance measure of the `“0”` _(ZERO, U+0030)_ glyph found in the font used to render it.  
The advance measure of a glyph is its advance width or height, whichever is in the inline axis of the element.

So however wide the `“0”` character is in a given typeface, that’s the measure of one ch.  
In monospace _(fixed-width)_ fonts, where all characters are the same width, 1ch equals one character.
