# CSS Grids

## Explicit and Implicit Grid

When we use `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` we create an Explicit Grid. However if we try and place an item outside of that grid the browser will create an Implicit Grid line or lines in order to hold that item.

## Grid auto flow

The grid-auto-flow CSS property controls how the auto-placement algorithm works, specifying exactly how auto-placed items get flowed into the grid.
